To use, you'll need npm/nodejs and mysql.

Clone the repo, install the dependencies for the frontend
```
npm i react react-router-dom axios
```
and backend
```
npm i body-parser cors express mv mysql2 nodemon prompt
```
run initBoards.js and configure the boards as you like.

then just run ```npm start``` in the front end and back end directories and you should be good to go

have fun :)
